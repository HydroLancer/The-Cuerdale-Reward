Practicioner Skills - Assignment 2

Level building is relatively simple. 

Make a scene in unity

Prefabs are mostly built, may need resizing (use the inspector, just use the scale)
for character animations, the character and enemy ones are already done, just add an animator component 
if its not already on there, and in the control option, add the relevant one.

if you feel like you can fix the code for collision resolution against boxes (can get stuck when jumping into the sides of them)
feel free to give it a shot, I'ma bit scared of poking it any harder lest it fall over

also, if you feel like it, try adding an attack function. I feel like the typical bouncing on enemies will do the trick but it's always nice to add more stuff

Just don't commit straight to master! 

drag and drop stuff, buzz me if something's up
